About the World database
========================

http://pgfoundry.org/projects/dbsamples/

World is a port of the example database available for MySQL on the mysql.com
website.

It is a simple 1:1 port and no attempt has been made to redesign the schema to
better suit PostgreSQL.

It is useful for comparison purposes and for learning how to execute simple
queries and create simple tables, but is not particularly useful for exercising
the advanced features of PostgreSQL or benchmarking.


Usage
=====

Execute the script world.sql as a database user with CREATE USER DATABASE privileges. For example:

	sudo su postgres -c "psql < world.sql"		# YMMV

You may now connect to the database with the user worlduser. The password is 'HahodOid3':

	psql -h localhost world worlduser
