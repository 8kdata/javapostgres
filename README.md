PostgreSQL and Java training
==========================

This repository contains the source code of the examples and code demos included in some of the "PostgreSQL and Java" trainings that [8Kdata][1] delivers.

Java source code
----------------

Included in the `java` directory are some maven-ized Java projects:

* `helloJDBC`: an iterative approach to JDBC, where a simple example is improved across several executable programs, adding better JDBC constructs and Java best-practices
* `hellojOOQ`: a simple project to show how to take back control of your SQL with [jOOQ][2]
* `helloMyBatis`: a simple project to show how to use the [MyBatis][3] mapper
* `helloProcessBuilder`: connect to PostgreSQL via the stdin
* `helloPool`: a simple project to show how to use of connection pool with [HikariCP][5] and [FlexyiPool][6]
* `helloPLJava`: call Java from inside of PostgreSQL via PL/Java

Example database
----------------

Included in the `db` directory is an example database used by the projects in the `java` folder. This database is derived from the [PgFoundry Sample Databases][4] world database.
